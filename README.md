- 👋 Hi, I’m @briandefox
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use Github...and practicing code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and brushing up on C (did a wee bit of C and assembly in EE)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programs that can scrape financial data from the web and process it
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play the piano for fun
